      I’m a UI/UX designer located in Canada and South Korea. I have a serious passion for Designing. 
      The driving force that energizes me to live my life is design and development, thinking and creating,
       and communication with people. 
      
      I don't want to say boring things such as 'UIUX designer passionate about design for users' 
      and 'creative designer'. This is because UIUX designers should design for users and designers should be creative. 
      
      I am an optimistic designer who lives happily doing what I want to do. Communicating with you, creating something valuable and continuing to develop make my heart skips a beat.
      <br>
      <br>
      To put my life in one word, it's art. When I was in high school from kindergarten, I received an art award every time. And luckily, I have had the experience of putting out my movie poster work at the exhibition. 
<br>
<br>
But let me tell you why I want to be a UIUX designer.
I used to express design with pencils, paper, and paint. 
I like myself constantly improving and I like the novelty of experiencing and learning what I haven't done. They were like endorphins. 

I saw my friend using Photoshop and it looked so amazing, fun, and cool. 
It took too long to express what I imagined with a pencil, but the fact that I could express it more realistically and quickly using the program captivated my mind.

Since then, I have been constantly thinking about what I can develop further by making various works using design-related programs. 

Now I'm introducing myself as a UIUX designer, but these days I'm interested in realizing web design, so I'm also focusing on development to introduce myself as a front-end developer a few years later.
